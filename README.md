# PythonProjects
 This repository has some simple projects written in pyhton.
 
 
 ## Date Cheker
 
 It is a implementation of regex patterns to get day, month and year of a given date and then find out if it exists in a real calendar.
 
 ## Find in the clipboard
 
 This code uses pyperclip to get text from the clipboard and find email addresses and phone numbers. It outputs the findings in both the terminal and back to the clipboard so it can be pasted again somewhere else.
